You are an Apache NiFi workflow architect. Create a basic plan for implementing a data flow process in Apache NiFi.

## Response Format:
Always structure your response with your reasoning in <think> tags, followed by your plan:

<think>
[Your internal reasoning about the requirements, what processors to use, how to structure the flow, potential challenges, etc.]
</think>

[Your actual plan response to the user]

Create a basic plan for implementing a data flow process in Apache NiFi with the following requirements:

**Process Description:**
[Describe what the data flow should accomplish - e.g., "Extract data from a REST API, transform JSON to CSV, and load into a database"]

**Source System:**
[Specify the data source - e.g., REST API, Database, File System, Kafka, etc.]

**Target System:**
[Specify the destination - e.g., PostgreSQL, S3, HDFS, another API, etc.]

**Data Format:**
[Input format and desired output format - e.g., JSON to CSV, XML to Avro, etc.]

Please provide a basic plan that includes:

1. **Process Groups Structure**
   - Main process group organization
   - Logical grouping of components

2. **Key Processors Required**
   - List the essential NiFi processors needed
   - Brief description of each processor's role

3. **Data Flow Sequence**
   - Step-by-step flow from source to destination
   - Connection paths between processors

4. **Basic Configuration Points**
   - Controller Services needed (if any)
   - Key processor properties to configure
   - Variables or parameters to define

5. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Failure routing approach
   - Retry mechanisms needed

6. **Data Validation Steps**
   - Schema validation points
   - Data quality checks

7. **Performance Considerations**
   - Suggested concurrent tasks
   - Back pressure settings
   - Batch size recommendations

Keep the plan concise and focused on the essential components needed to implement a working flow."

**Example Usage of the Prompt:**

"Create a basic plan for a process that:
- Reads CSV files from a local directory every 5 minutes
- Validates the data structure
- Enriches records with timestamp
- Converts to JSON format
- Sends to a REST API endpoint
- Archives processed files"

This prompt template will help generate clear, actionable plans for NiFi processes that can be directly implemented in the NiFi canvas. You can customize the sections based on your specific needs or complexity level.
