 Features

 Apache NiFi is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and distribute data.

 NiFi automates cybersecurity, observability, event streams, and generative AI data pipelines and distribution for thousands of companies worldwide across every industry.

 • Browser User Interface • Seamless experience for design, control, and monitoring • Runtime management and versioned pipelines • Secure by default with HTTPS • Scalable Processing • Configurable prioritization for throughput and latency • Guaranteed delivery with retry and backoff strategies • Horizontal scaling with clustering • Provenance Tracking • Searchable history with configurable attributes • Graph data lineage from source to destination • Metadata and content for each processing decision • Extensible Design • Plugin interface for Processors and Controller Services • Support for Processors in native Python • REST API for orchestration and monitoring • Secure Configuration • Single sign-on with OpenID Connect or SAML 2 • Flexible authorization policies for role-based access • Encrypted communication with TLS and SFTP Requirements

 NiFi supports modern operating systems and requires recent language versions for developing and running the application.

 Platform Requirements

 • Java 21 Optional Dependencies

 • Python 3.10 or higher Projects

 The source repository includes several component projects.

 Please review individual project documentation for additional details.

 • Apache NiFi • Apache NiFi Registry • Apache NiFi MiNiFi Getting Started

 Project guides provide extensive documentation for installing and extending the application.

 • Getting Started • User Guide • Administrator Guide • Developer Guide Developing

 NiFi uses the Maven Wrapper for project development. The Maven Wrapper provides shell scripts that download and cache a selected version of Apache Maven for running build commands.

 Developing on Microsoft Windows requires using mvnw.cmd instead of mvnw to run Maven commands.

 Building

 Run the following command to build project modules using parallel execution:

 ./mvnw install -T1C Run the following command to build project modules using parallel execution with static analysis to confirm compliance with code and licensing requirements:

 ./mvnw install -T1C -P contrib-check Run the following command to build the application binaries without building other optional modules:

 ./mvnw install -T1C -am -pl :nifi-assembly Binaries

 The nifi-assembly module contains the binary distribution.

 ls nifi-assembly/target/nifi-*-bin.zip The nifi-assembly module includes the binary distribution in a directory for local development and testing.

 cd nifi-assembly/target/nifi-*-bin/nifi-*/ Running

 NiFi provides shell scripts for starting and stopping the system.

 Running on Microsoft Windows requires using nifi.cmd instead of nifi.sh for system commands.

 Starting

 Run the following command to start NiFi from the distribution directory:

 ./bin/nifi.sh start Accessing

 The default configuration generates a random username and password on startup. NiFi writes the generated credentials to the application log located in logs/nifi-app.log under the NiFi installation directory.

 The following command can be used to find the generated credentials on operating systems with grep installed:

 grep Generated logs/nifi-app*log NiFi logs the generated credentials as follows:

 Generated Username [USERNAME]
Generated Password [PASSWORD] The USERNAME will be a random UUID composed of 36 characters. The PASSWORD will be a random string.

 The username and password can be replaced with custom credentials using the following command:

 ./bin/nifi.sh set-single-user-credentials <username> <password> NiFi defaults to running on the localhost address with HTTPS on port 8443 at the following URL:

 https://localhost:8443/nifi
 Browsers will display a warning message indicating a potential security risk due to the self-signed certificate generated during initialization. Production deployments should provision a certificate from a trusted certificate authority and update the NiFi keystore and truststore configuration.
