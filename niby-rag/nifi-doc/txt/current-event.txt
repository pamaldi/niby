 The ASF runs and participates in a number of events related to our Apache projects throughout the year. These events have three main purposes:

 • Educate the world about the work and mission of the ASF • Provide technical information about our many Apache projects • Build developer and user communities Running a third party or project event? You must comply with the events branding policy.

 The ASF Travel Assistance Committee provides financial assistance for selected ASF events, to those who would otherwise be unable to attend them.
