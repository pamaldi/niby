 Apache NiFi welcomes the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. Project Management Committee members will collaborate and respond to potential vulnerabilities, providing an assessment of the concern and a plan of action to remediate verified issues.

 Reporting Policy

 Please read the Apache Project Security for Committers policy for general guidelines applicable disclosure of security issues for Apache Software Foundation projects.

 Do not perform the following actions after discovering a potential security concern:

 • Open a Jira disclosing a security vulnerability to the public • Send a message to the project mailing lists disclosing a security vulnerability to the public • Send a message to the project Slack instance disclosing a security vulnerability to the public Security Model

 Apache NiFi provides a framework for developing processing pipelines using standard and custom components. Authenticated and authorized users are responsible for the security of operating system commands and custom code. Privileged users are also responsible for designing processing pipelines with security measures appropriate to the level of trust expected for systems and services providing input to such processing pipelines.

 Configuring dangerous operating system commands or custom scripts is not a project security vulnerability.

 The framework supports configurable permissions that enable authorized users to execute code using several standard components. Components such as ExecuteProcess and ExecuteStreamCommand support running operating system commands, while other scripted components support executing custom code using different programming languages. Configuring these components with untrusted commands or arguments is contrary to best practices, but it does not constitute of security issue for remediation.

 Reporting Process

 • Notify the project on initial discovery of a potential security vulnerability • Provide a reasonable amount of time for an initial assessment and remediation plan • Limit interaction to accounts under direct control or accounts with explicit permission of the owner • Avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of services • Avoid spamming, social engineering, and methods to manipulate project members Reporting Methods

 • Security Mailing List: security@nifi.apache.org • Members of the Project Management Committee monitor this private mailing list and respond to disclosures Severity Ratings

 Severity ratings represent the determination of project members based on an evaluation of Common Vulnerability Scoring System calculations.

 • Critical: Arbitrary code execution from a remote attacker • High: Compromise of integrity or availability through resource exhaustion • Medium: Requires special configuration settings and significant mitigations are available • Low: Minimal impact and significant difficulty of exploitation Published Vulnerabilities

 The following announcements include published vulnerabilities that apply directly to Apache NiFi components.

 CVE-2025-27017

 • Title: Potential Insertion of MongoDB Password in Provenance Record • Published: 2025-03-11 • Severity: Medium • Products: Apache NiFi • Affected Versions: 1.13.0 to 2.2.0 • Fixed Versions: 2.3.0 • Reporter: Robert Creese • References • CVE Record: CVE-2025-27017 • NVD Record: CVE-2025-27017 • Apache Jira Issue: NIFI-14272 • GitHub Pull Request: 9723 Apache NiFi 1.13.0 through 2.2.0 includes the username and password used to authenticate with MongoDB in the NiFi provenance events that MongoDB components generate during processing. An authorized user with read access to the provenance events of those processors may see the credentials information. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.3.0 is the recommended mitigation, which removes the credentials from provenance event records. 

 CVE-2024-56512

 • Title: Missing Complete Authorization for Parameter and Service References • Published: 2024-12-27 • Severity: Low • Products: Apache NiFi • Affected Versions: 1.10.0 to 2.0.0 • Fixed Versions: 2.1.0 • Reporter: Matt Gilman • References • CVE Record: CVE-2024-56512 • NVD Record: CVE-2024-56512 • Apache Jira Issue: NIFI-13976 • GitHub Pull Request: 9535 Apache NiFi 1.10.0 through 2.0.0 are missing fine-grained authorization checking for Parameter Contexts, referenced Controller Services, and referenced Parameter Providers, when creating new Process Groups. Creating a new Process Group can include binding to a Parameter Context, but in cases where the Process Group did not reference any Parameter values, the framework did not check user authorization for the bound Parameter Context. Missing authorization for a bound Parameter Context enabled clients to download non-sensitive Parameter values after creating the Process Group. Creating a new Process Group can also include referencing existing Controller Services or Parameter Providers. The framework did not check user authorization for referenced Controller Services or Parameter Providers, enabling clients to create Process Groups and use these components that were otherwise unauthorized. This vulnerability is limited in scope to authenticated users authorized to create Process Groups. The scope is further limited to deployments with component-based authorization policies. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.1.0 is the recommended mitigation, which includes authorization checking for Parameter and Controller Service references on Process Group creation. 

 CVE-2024-52067

 • Title: Potential Insertion of Sensitive Parameter Values in Debug Log • Published: 2024-11-20 • Severity: Medium • Products: Apache NiFi • Affected Versions: 1.16.0 to 1.28.0 and 2.0.0-M1 to 2.0.0-M4 • Fixed Versions: 1.28.1 and 2.0.0 • Reporter: David Handermann • References • CVE Record: CVE-2024-52067 • NVD Record: CVE-2024-52067 • Apache Jira Issue: NIFI-13971 • GitHub Pull Request: 9489 Apache NiFi 1.16.0 through 1.28.0 and 2.0.0-M1 through 2.0.0-M4 include optional debug logging of Parameter Context values during the flow synchronization process. An authorized administrator with access to change logging levels could enable debug logging for framework flow synchronization, causing the application to write Parameter names and values to the application log. Parameter Context values may contain sensitive information depending on application flow configuration. Deployments of Apache NiFi with the default Logback configuration do not log Parameter Context values. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.0.0 or 1.28.1 is the recommendation mitigation, eliminating Parameter value logging from the flow synchronization process regardless of the Logback configuration.

The ShellUserGroupProvider is not included in the default configuration. Command injection requires ShellUserGroupProvider to be one of the enabled User Group Providers in the Authorizers configuration. Command injection also requires an authenticated user with elevated privileges. Apache NiFi requires an authenticated user with authorization to modify access policies to execute the command. Apache NiFi Registry requires an authenticated user with authorization to read user groups to execute the command. NiFi and NiFi Registry version 1.16.3 has completely removed the shell commands from the ShellUserGroupProvider that received user arguments. 

 CVE-2022-29265

 • Title: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity References in Multiple Components • Published: 2022-04-29 • Severity: Medium • Products: Apache NiFi • Affected Versions: 0.0.1 to 1.16.0 • Fixed Versions: 1.16.1 • Reporter: David Handermann at exceptionfactory.com • References • CVE Record: CVE-2022-29265 • NVD Record: CVE-2022-29265 • Apache Jira Issue: NIFI-9901 • GitHub Pull Request: 5962 Multiple components in Apache NiFi 0.0.1 to 1.16.0 do not restrict XML External Entity references in the default configuration. The Standard Content Viewer service attempts to resolve XML External Entity references when viewing formatted XML files. The following Processors attempt to resolve XML External Entity references when configured with default property values: EvaluateXPath, EvaluateXQuery, and ValidateXml. Apache NiFi flow configurations that include these Processors are vulnerable to malicious XML documents that contain Document Type Declarations with XML External Entity references. Upgrading to NiFi 1.16.1 disables Document Type Declarations in the default configuration for these processors, and disallows XML External Entity resolution in standard services. 

 CVE-2022-26850

 • Title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials for Single-User Authentication • Published: 2022-03-27 • Severity: Low • Products: Apache NiFi • Affected Versions: 1.14.0 to 1.15.3 • Fixed Versions: 1.16.0 • Reporter: Jonathan Leitschuh at twitter.com/jlleitschuh • References • CVE Record: CVE-2022-26850 • NVD Record: CVE-2022-26850 • Apache Jira Issue: NIFI-9785 • GitHub Pull Request: 5856 When creating or updating credentials for single-user access, NiFi wrote a copy of the Login Identity Providers configuration to the operating system temporary directory. The Login Identity Providers configuration file contains the username and a bcrypt hash of the configured password. On most platforms, the operating system temporary directory has global read permissions. NiFi immediately moved the temporary file to the final configuration directory, which significantly limited the window of opportunity for access. Bcrypt is a password-hashing algorithm that incorporates a random salt and a specified cost factor, designed to maintain resistance to brute-force attacks. Use of the bcrypt algorithm minimizes the impact of disclosing the single-user credentials stored in Login Identity Providers. NiFi 1.16.0 includes updates to replace the Login Identity Providers configuration without writing a file to the operating system temporary directory.
